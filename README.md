# Learning In Public To Make Algorithm Interview Prep More Engaging
Making (re)learning graphs algorithms more engaging for myself by learning in public.

After reading Ali Abdal's Feel Good Productivity and Learn In Public vy SWYX, I've decided to make my algorithm interview prep more engaging by creating videos and exercises while I (re)-learn graph algorithms. Graph algorithms are my weakness. The first time I absolutely failed an online assessment was for Amazon's intern intake in the summer of 2021 where I forgot how to use Dijkstra's to find a shortest path.
More recently, more CentML, I failed a much more complicated algorithm that was concerned with finding where between two graphs, could I insert an edge such that the resulting super-graph had minimum distance between any two nodes in the graph. This will be included in the repo.

Further, I highly recommend the previously mentioned book and article. For developers, I think these two ideas go hand-in-hand.

# Personal Notes
## Procedure
Let's keep this procedure simple as possible, optimising for output instead of quality. Since I've never learned in public, I want to just get use to it before I think about making it pretty.

3-Step: Learn -> Create Python Files with generous commments and in-text diagram -> Screen Record over them
